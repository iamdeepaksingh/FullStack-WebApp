# GloboEvents Frontend Documentation

This is the frontend part of the GloboEvents application. It allows users to search for events in a specified city by interacting with the backend service.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the user interface.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file that handles user interactions and API requests.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the frontend application.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

- Enter a city name in the input field and submit the form.
- The application will fetch and display a list of events happening in that city.

## Running the Application

No additional setup is required for the frontend. Just open the `index.html` file in your browser after starting the backend server. Make sure the backend is running to handle API requests.
